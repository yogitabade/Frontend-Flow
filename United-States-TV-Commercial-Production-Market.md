SMEs tend to focus on building brand recognition, engaging local communities, and reaching target markets through both national and regional campaigns. As digital transformation continues, the flexibility of SMEs allows them to quickly adapt to evolving trends, including the integration of TV commercial content with online marketing strategies. The market for SMEs is expected to grow as these businesses continue to prioritize professional advertising content as a means to elevate their brand presence and compete with larger companies in their respective industries.</p><h2>TV Commercial Production Market By Application: Big Business</h2><p>On the other hand, the Big Business segment represents established companies with extensive marketing budgets, where TV commercial production is an essential tool for large-scale brand promotion.
